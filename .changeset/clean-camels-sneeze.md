'@backstage/create-app': patch
---

Newly created Backstage repositories now use the stable version 6 of
`react-router`, just like the main repo does. Please let us know if you find any
issues with this.

Migrating to the stable version of `react-router` is optional for the time
being. But if you want to do the same for your existing repository, please
follow [this
guide](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/react-router-stable-migration).
